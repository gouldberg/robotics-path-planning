# robotics-path-planning
- The codes and scripts here are **almost totally** from https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics, which is awesome !!
- I have just arranged the codes and add some experiments.
- I recognized sobol sampler is critically important for RRT path planning algorithm.
- Closed loop RRT star is interesting.
